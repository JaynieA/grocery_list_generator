#Description

Build a grocery list containing all of the ingredients necessary to make the number of meals of your choosing. The grocery list will be sorted based on ingredient and the general area of the grocery store the item is expected to be in.
User inputs only one thing- the number of meals that they would like to shop for. The rest is randomly generated based on the recipes that exist within the database.
